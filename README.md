##Pig Latinizer

###Description
Create an application with one text field where a user can type in a word. When the user hits enter, the app should convert that word into pig latin and display the pig latinized version on the page. You can read about the rules for pig latin [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin#Rules).

1. Add "yay" to the end of any word that begins with a vowel. This is probably the easiest place to get started.
2. For words that begin with consonant sounds, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence. Then, add "ay".
3. If you still have time, you can move on to some more complex pig latin rules

###Bonus
Let your app convert entire sentences to pig latin, not just one word.
